+ +		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+ +		       Version 2, June 1991
+ +
+ + Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+ + 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
+ + Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ + of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+ +
+ +[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
+ + numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
+ +
+ +			    Preamble
+ +
+ +  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+ +freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+ +Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+ +free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+ +
+ +  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
+ +specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
+ +other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
+ +your libraries, too.
+ +
+ +  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+ +price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+ +have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+ +this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+ +if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+ +in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+ +
+ +  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+ +anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+ +These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
+ +you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
+ +
+ +  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+ +or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+ +you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+ +code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
+ +complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
+ +with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
+ +it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+ +
+ +  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
+ +the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
+ +permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+ +
+ +  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
+ +that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+ +library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+ +want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
+ +version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
+ +the original authors' reputations.
+ +
+ +  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+ +patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
+ +software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
+ +transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
+ +we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
+ +free use or not licensed at all.
+ +
+ +  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
+ +GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
+ +license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
+ +designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
+ +one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
+ +the same as in the ordinary license.
+ +
+ +  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
+ +they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
+ +program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
+ +changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
+ +analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
+ +a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
+ +derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
+ +treats it as such.
+ +
+ +  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
+ +Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
+ +sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
+ +concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
+ +
+ +  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
+ +users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
+ +libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
+ +permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
+ +preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
+ +libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
+ +this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
+ +changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
+ +will lead to faster development of free libraries.
+ +
+ +  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+ +modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+ +"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+ +former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
+ +works together with the library.
+ +
+ +  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
+ +General Public License rather than by this special one.
+ +
+ +		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+ +   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+ +
+ +  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
+ +contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
+ +party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
+ +General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
+ +addressed as "you".
+ +
+ +  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+ +prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+ +(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+ +
+ +  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+ +which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+ +Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+ +copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+ +portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+ +straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+ +included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+ +
+ +  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+ +making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+ +all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+ +interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+ +and installation of the library.
+ +
+ +  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+ +covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+ +running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+ +such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+ +on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+ +writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+ +and what the program that uses the Library does.
+ +  
+ +  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+ +complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+ +you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+ +appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+ +all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+ +warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+ +Library.
+ +
+ +  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+ +and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+ +fee.
+ +
+ +  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+ +of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+ +distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+ +above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+ +
+ +    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+ +
+ +    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+ +    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+ +
+ +    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+ +    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+ +
+ +    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+ +    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+ +    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+ +    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+ +    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+ +    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+ +    its purpose remains meaningful.
+ +
+ +    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+ +    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+ +    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+ +    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+ +    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+ +    root function must still compute square roots.)
+ +
+ +These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+ +identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+ +and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+ +themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+ +sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+ +distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+ +on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+ +this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+ +entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+ +it.
+ +
+ +Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+ +your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+ +exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+ +collective works based on the Library.
+ +
+ +In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+ +with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+ +a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+ +the scope of this License.
+ +
+ +  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+ +License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+ +this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+ +that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+ +instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ +ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+ +that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+ +these notices.
+ +
+ +  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+ +that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+ +subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+ +
+ +  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+ +the Library into a program that is not a library.
+ +
+ +  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+ +derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+ +under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+ +it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+ +must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+ +medium customarily used for software interchange.
+ +
+ +  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+ +from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+ +source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+ +distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+ +compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+ +
+ +  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+ +Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+ +linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+ +work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+ +therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+ +
+ +  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+ +creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+ +contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+ +library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+ +Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+ +
+ +  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+ +that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+ +derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+ +Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+ +linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+ +threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+ +
+ +  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+ +structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+ +functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+ +file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+ +work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+ +Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+ +
+ +  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+ +distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+ +Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+ +whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+ +
+ +  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
+ +link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+ +work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+ +under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+ +modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+ +engineering for debugging such modifications.
+ +
+ +  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+ +Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+ +this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+ +during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+ +copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+ +directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+ +of these things:
+ +
+ +    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+ +    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+ +    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+ +    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+ +    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+ +    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+ +    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+ +    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+ +    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+ +    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+ +    to use the modified definitions.)
+ +
+ +    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+ +    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+ +    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+ +    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+ +
+ +    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+ +    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+ +    specified materials from the same place.
+ +
+ +    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+ +    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+ +
+ +  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+ +Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+ +reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+ +the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
+ +distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+ +components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+ +which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+ +the executable.
+ +
+ +  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+ +restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+ +accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+ +use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+ +distribute.
+ +
+ +  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+ +Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+ +facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+ +library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+ +the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+ +permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+ +
+ +    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+ +    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+ +    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+ +    Sections above.
+ +
+ +    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+ +    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+ +    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+ +
+ +  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+ +the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+ +attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+ +distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+ +rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+ +or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+ +terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+ +
+ +  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+ +signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+ +distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+ +prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+ +modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+ +Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+ +all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+ +the Library or works based on it.
+ +
+ +  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+ +Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+ +original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+ +subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+ +restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+ +You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+ +this License.
+ +
+ +  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+ +infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+ +conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+ +otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+ +excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+ +distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+ +License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+ +may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+ +license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+ +all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+ +the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+ +refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+ +
+ +If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+ +particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+ +and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+ +
+ +It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+ +patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+ +such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+ +integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+ +implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+ +generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+ +through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+ +system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+ +to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+ +impose that choice.
+ +
+ +This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+ +be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+ +
+ +  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+ +certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+ +original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+ +an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+ +so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+ +excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+ +written in the body of this License.
+ +
+ +  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+ +versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
+ +Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+ +but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+ +
+ +Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+ +specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+ +"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+ +conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+ +the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+ +license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+ +the Free Software Foundation.
+ +
+ +  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+ +programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+ +write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+ +copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+ +Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+ +decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+ +of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+ +and reuse of software generally.
+ +
+ +			    NO WARRANTY
+ +
+ +  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+ +WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+ +EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+ +OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+ +KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+ +IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+ +PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+ +LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+ +THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+ +
+ +  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+ +WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+ +AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+ +FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+ +CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+ +LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+ +RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+ +FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+ +SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+ +DAMAGES.
+ +
+ +		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+ +
+ +     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+ +
+ +  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+ +possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+ +everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+ +redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ +ordinary General Public License).
+ +
+ +  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is

+ +# up nothing. Note that if the search failed due to some other reason
+ +# (like no NIS server responding) then the search continues with the
+ +# next entry.
+ +#
+ +# Valid entries include:
+ +#
+ +#	nisplus			Use NIS+ (NIS version 3)
+ +#	nis			Use NIS (NIS version 2), also called YP
+ +#	dns			Use DNS (Domain Name Service)
+ +#	files			Use the local files
+ +#	db			Use the local database (.db) files
+ +#	compat			Use NIS on compat mode
+ +#	hesiod			Use Hesiod for user lookups
+ +#	[NOTFOUND=return]	Stop searching if not found so far
+ +#
+ +
+ +# To use db, put the "db" in front of "files" for entries you want to be
+ +# looked up first in the databases
+ +#
+ +# Example:
+ +#passwd:    db files nisplus nis
