+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS(PATH_LIST)
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   PATH_LIST is a space-separated list of colon-separated triplets of the
+#   form 'FROM:TO:RESULT'. This function iterates over these triplets and
+#   set $RESULT to the relative path from $FROM to $TO. Note that $FROM and
+#   $TO needs to be absolute filenames for this macro to success.
+#
+#   For instance,
+#
+#     first=/usr/local/bin
+#     second=/usr/local/share
+#     AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([first:second:fs second:first:sf])
+#     # $fs is set to ../share
+#     # $sf is set to ../bin
+#
+#   $FROM and $TO are both eval'ed recursively and normalized, this means
+#   that you can call this macro with autoconf's dirnames like `prefix' or
+#   `datadir'. For example:
+#
+#     AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([bindir:datadir:bin_to_data])
+#
+#   AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS should also works with DOS filenames.
+#
+#   You may want to use this macro in order to make your package
+#   relocatable. Instead of hardcoding $datadir into your programs just
+#   encode $bin_to_data and try to determine $bindir at run-time.
+#
+#   This macro requires AX_NORMALIZE_PATH.

+#   AX_NORMALIZE_PATH(VARNAME, [REFERENCE_STRING])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   Perform some cleanups on the value of $VARNAME (interpreted as a path):
+#
+#     - empty paths are changed to '.'
+#     - trailing slashes are removed
+#     - repeated slashes are squeezed except a leading doubled slash '//'
+#       (which might indicate a networked disk on some OS).
+#
+#   REFERENCE_STRING is used to turn '/' into '\' and vice-versa: if
+#   REFERENCE_STRING contains some backslashes, all slashes and backslashes
+#   are turned into backslashes, otherwise they are all turned into slashes.
+#
+#   This makes processing of DOS filenames quite easier, because you can
+#   turn a filename to the Unix notation, make your processing, and turn it
+#   back to original notation.
+#
+#     filename='A:\FOO\\BAR\'
+#     old_filename="$filename"
+#     # Switch to the unix notation
+#     AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["/"])
+#     # now we have $filename = 'A:/FOO/BAR' and we can process it as if
+#     # it was a Unix path.  For instance let's say that you want
+#     # to append '/subpath':
+#     filename="$filename/subpath"
+#     # finally switch back to the original notation
+#     AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["$old_filename"])
+#     # now $filename equals to 'A:\FOO\BAR\subpath'
+#
+#   One good reason to make all path processing with the unix convention is
+#   that backslashes have a special meaning in many cases. For instance
+#
+#     expr 'A:\FOO' : 'A:\Foo'
+#
+#   will return 0 because the second argument is a regex in which
+#   backslashes have to be backslashed. In other words, to have the two
+#   strings to match you should write this instead:
+#
+#     expr 'A:\Foo' : 'A:\\Foo'
+#
+#   Such behavior makes DOS filenames extremely unpleasant to work with. So
+#   temporary turn your paths to the Unix notation, and revert them to the
+#   original notation after the processing. See the macro
+#   AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS for a concrete example of this.
+#
+#   REFERENCE_STRING defaults to $VARIABLE, this means that slashes will be
+#   converted to backslashes if $VARIABLE already contains some backslashes
+#   (see $thirddir below).

+# This is what autoupdate's m4 run will expand.  It fires
+# the warning (with _au_warn_XXX), outputs it into the
+# updated configure.ac (with AC_DIAGNOSE), and then outputs
+# the replacement expansion.
+
+
+# This is an auxiliary macro that is also run when
+# autoupdate runs m4.  It simply calls m4_warning, but
+# we need a wrapper so that each warning is emitted only
+# once.  We break the quoting in m4_warning's argument in
+# order to expand this macro's arguments, not AU_DEFUN's.
+
+
+# Finally, this is the expansion that is picked up by
+# autoconf.  It tells the user to run autoupdate, and
+# then outputs the replacement expansion.  We do not care
+# about autoupdate's warning because that contains
+# information on what to do *after* running autoupdate.
+
+
+
+## Note:
+## *****
+## The following helper macros are too fragile to be used out
+## of AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS (mainly because they assume that
+## paths are normalized), that's why I'm keeping them in the same file.
+## Still, some of them maybe worth to reuse.
